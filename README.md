# Game of Life

Plans

- [ ] implement gui using [pyxel](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel)
- [ ] infinite field:
  - field is split into 32x32 (or 64x64) blocks, where each line in a block is an integer, where each cell is a bit
- [ ] game loop

See [models.py](game_of_life/models.py) for inner implementation of the game field.
